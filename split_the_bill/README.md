# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Taaruni Ananya**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**DiscordDawgs** is an android app that was riddle with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes!  It is made for dogs to discuss various topics.
